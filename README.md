# Building a Portfolio site

## About

I created a responsive portfolio site using CSS, HTML. The site works well within mobile and also table screen sizes. In order to make the site responsive I used media queries for text elements such as the P, H1, H2 tags. For the layout of the portfolio content I used a CSS grid. But before that I needed to build some cards to fill my grid. See the code below.

One having built my cards it was an easy job of laying out the grid template and then placing the card elements inside. I encountered an issue where I couldn't get the grid to behave responsively in the manner I had wanted and spent a while trying to resolve that issue. As it was working differently to how my other grids had behaved. I believe it was down to the media queries. As a result adding in one query to address how the cards should display on smaller views fixed the issue and the grid behaved as expected. 

## Deployment
